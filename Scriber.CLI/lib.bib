 abstract = {Papers from a November 2001 conference discuss maintenance issues for both existing and emerging software systems. Themes include software evolution, maintenance metrics, reverse engineering, program analysis, slicing, impact analysis, and effort analysis. Other themes are software architectures, behavior of concurrent programs, UML, maintenance process assessment and improvement, distributed object systems, business models, legacy systems, and reengineering. Specific topics include software renewal process comprehension using dynamic effort estimation, cost-effective maintenance tools for proprietary languages, modeling clones evolution through time series, measuring behavioral correspondence to a timed concurrent model, and reverse engineering of the UML class diagram from C++ code in the presence of weakly typed containers.

Building on previous work, we theoretically show that edGNN, our model for directed labeled graphs, is as powerful as the Weisfeiler--Lehman algorithm for graph isomorphism. Our experiments support our theoretical findings, confirming that graph neural networks can be used effectively for inference problems on directed graphs with both node and edge labels.

@misc{Kriege.2019,
 abstract = {Graph kernels have become an established and widely-used technique for solving classification tasks on graphs. This survey gives a comprehensive overview of techniques for kernel-based graph classification developed in the past 15 years. We describe and categorize graph kernels based on properties inherent to their design, such as the nature of their extracted graph features, their method of computation and their applicability to problems in practice. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we study the classification accuracy of a large suite of graph kernels on established benchmarks as well as new datasets. We compare the performance of popular kernels with several baseline methods and study the effect of applying a Gaussian RBF kernel to the metric induced by a graph kernel. In doing so, we find that simple baselines become competitive after this transformation on some datasets. Moreover, we study the extent to which existing graph kernels agree in their predictions (and prediction errors) and obtain a data-driven categorization of kernels as result. Finally, based on our experimental results, we derive a practitioner's guide to kernel-based graph classification.},

@article{Scarselli.2009,
 abstract = {Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) is an element of IR(m) that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.},

@article{Zanoni.2015,
 abstract = {The detection of design patterns is a useful activity giving support to the comprehension and maintenance of software systems. Many approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature providing different results. In this paper, we extend a previous work regarding the application of machine learning techniques for design pattern detection, by adding a more extensive experimentation and enhancements in the analysis method. Here we exploit a combination of graph matching and machine learning techniques, implemented in a tool we developed, called MARPLE-DPD. Our approach allows the application of machine learning techniques, leveraging a modeling of design patterns that is able to represent pattern instances composed of a variable number of classes. We describe the experimentations for the detection of five design patterns on 10 open source software systems, compare the performances obtained by different learning models with respect to a baseline, and discuss the encountered issues.},

 abstract = {An important problem in robotics is the empirical evaluation of classification algorithms that allow a robotic system to make accurate categorical predictions about its environment. Current algorithms are often assessed using sample statistics that can be difficult to interpret correctly and do not always provide a principled way of comparing competing algorithms. In this paper, we present a probabilistic alternative based on a Bayesian framework for inferring on balanced accuracies. Using the proposed probabilistic evaluation, it is possible to assess the balanced accuracy's posterior distribution of binary and multiclass classifiers. In addition, competing classifiers can be compared based on their respective posterior distributions. We illustrate the practical utility of our scheme and its properties by reanalyzing the performance of a recently published algorithm in the domain of visual action detection and on synthetic data. To facilitate its use, we provide an open-source MATLAB implementation.},

@proceedings{Fred.2004,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present a new neural network model, called graph neural network model, which is a generalization of two existing approaches, viz., the graph focused approach, and the node focused approach. The graph focused approach considers the mapping from a graph structure to a real vector, in which the mapping is independent of the particular node involved; while the node focused approach considers the mapping from a graph structure to a real vector, in which the mapping depends on the properties of the node involved. It is shown that the graph neural network model maintains some of the characteristics of the graph focused models and the node focused models respectively. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the graph neural network model. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and demonstrate the generalization capability of the proposed model.},
